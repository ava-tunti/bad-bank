## Good Bank Project - Ava Tunti
This is a bank app simulator, allowing you to do create/login to an account and withdraw and deposit money. It can help students further understand how to develop a full stack application and create their own code. I built it to further develop my knowledge of front-end and back-end web development, including MongoDB and Express. This has really helped me cement my learning of these coding languages and tools.

# Future Improvements
I'm currently working on adding authentication to the app and connecting my front-end (not the one from the exercise, but my formatted, customized one) to the back-end. Little tweaks will probably pop up from time to time and I will update this. The app is still currently under development, and I will upload a screenshot once it is complete!
